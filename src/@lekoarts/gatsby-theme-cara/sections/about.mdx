## About

I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of York with an avid interest in software engineering, especially in **JavaScript** and **Python**.

My current goal is to continue learning **Node.js** (backend) and **React.js** (frontend).

I'm open to any work/projects, feel free to contact me on one of the platforms below.
